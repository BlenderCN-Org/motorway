MOTORWAY (SHITTY) TODO
----------
Stuff todo for the project

[Editor]
    <Road Network Editor>
        > TopDown View ('Map' like view)
        > Road Generation (Bezier Curve and shiet)
        > 'Road Profile' (material, AI node, etc.)
        > Procedural road generation (noise based?)
    > Better mouse picking (color buffer instead of bounding geometry?)
    <Material Editor Unfuckery>
        > Fix layer blending for edge cases (see bug reports)
        > Proper Material compilation (compute shader permutations; compute antialiased normals/roughness; etc.)
    
[Engine]
    > Implement proper memory allocators (pool/heap/stack/fast hashmap/etc.)
    <Terrain Rendering/Physics>
        > Still need to figure out stuff (check state of art)
    > Implement Software Occlusion Culling (see Intel mess and whitepapers)
    > Finish Vulkan port
    > Jobify CPU work (see Destiny presentation)
    > Implement Instanciation (should help for Vulkan port)
    > Better physics
    > Grass rendering (see Boulanger paper)
	> DoD Scene Class
	
[Client]
    > Implement Client to Server connection (see old code)
    > Implement Client chat (server sided)
    > Move Physics to server side (use Client prediction only?)
    
[Assets]
    > Vehicle custom format (graphics/physics/audio properties in a txt file)
    > Create assets (world/vehicle)

    ----------
DONE

[Editor]    
	<Material Editor Unfuckery>
        > Fix serialization/deserialization
        > Per SubMesh Material Instance (allow local override; dont apply changes to instancied material)		
    > Split Client and Editor contexts
    
[Engine]
    > Fix AutoExposure glitches (tip: do calibration with EV100 rule)
    <Specular AntiAliasing>
        > Finalize VMF Compute shader
        > Editor Panel (material editor only or dedicated one?)
        > How should it be saved? Draft idea: compute both rt at frame N, save to disk at frame N+1 (basically wait for 
          the previous cmdlist to be finished)
