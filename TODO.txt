[ENGINE]
    - Support multiscreens
        * Provide origin coordinates as parameter (x,y); create the windows with the specified origin
        * Use GetMonitorInfo( MonitorFromWindow( surface->Handle, MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY ), &mi );
          to figure out which monitor is the closest to the app rect (x, y, x + width, y + height rectangle)
        * Use the same monitor handle when creating the render device
    - Implement RenderDoc API (see renderdoc header in 3rd party folder)
    - Implement NVAPI
    - Implement AMD AGS
    - Allow refresh rate selection
        * e.g. "RefreshRate = 60 ; in Hz" in envars file
        * If the refresh rate is unavailable on the current monitor, fallback to the safest one (the lowest one?)
